## 📖 Overview

**Data is only as valuable as the insights we can extract from it.** This project focuses on **Atliq Hardwares** (a fictional hardware company), addressing the challenge of evaluating sales performance and financial health in a dynamic market. 

I have designed a suite of comprehensive Excel reports that empower the sales team and management to track customer performance, understand market trends, and analyze P&L statements across different fiscal periods and regions.
